## Team Fortress 2 Gamemode
The source code for the Team Fortress 2 Gamemode.
IF YOU HAVE ANY OF ADDONS SOMETIMES EVEN 1 WILL BREAK THE GAMEMODE
The Gamemode that allows you to play TF2 in Gmod!
Pre-Owners - Kilburn, wango911 
Workshopper - Agent Agrimar

If you're wondering why _Kilburn ended the development was because he had a hard drive failure and lost all his data. I was in talks with some other dude in regards to bringing back the gamemode, but I have not talked to the guy in months, so I'm guessing his branch is dead. - [N?] SmileyFace (A.K.A wango911)
